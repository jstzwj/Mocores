#Introduction
Mocores is a distributed computing system that utilizes idle computer resources. Unlike other distributed systems, the subnodes of the system can be unreliable and have poor network communication. The system is suitable for solving problems with large computationally intensive parallelism problems.

#Environment compatibility
This software is writen in c++ 11. It was tested in MSVC15 and GNUC4.9.2 compiler.
